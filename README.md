# Machine_Learning_Homeworks
The Homeworks consisted in three different tasks each of them based on the three main different topics of the lectures of the course, every code is written in Python and the algorithms adopted to succeed in the taks are the ones implemented in Sci-kit learn packages :

## Regression:
We tried to predict the burnt area of a forest via regression using different methods 

## Classification:
The target was to correctly classify the cancer type of the patients in benign or malignant

## Clustering:
In this case I used different clustering strategies to group a certain number of mice dividing them in 8 different classes based on the ones described in the article realted to the dataset
